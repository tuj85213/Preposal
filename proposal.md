# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Air Hockey

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

This will be an air hockey game with sprites that resemble air hockey paddle with customizable colors (potentially shapes).

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our software will simulate a game of pong in the form of air hockey. The user will play a game against a computer opponent. The players will play up to 5 rounds. Each player will earn one point for landing the puck in the opposite players goal. The player to reach 5 points first wins the round. Once a player wins 3 rounds, they've won the game. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A game of pong resembling air hockey.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A game of air hockey with sprite paddles.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A game of air hockey with sprite paddles, customizable paddle shapes and colors.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We will need to learn how to create a pong game and how to use sprites. We will follow tutorials and combine both aspects as well as possible. We will also learn our way around pygame. We three members will meet on Thursday to distribute responsibilities and walk through the tutorials together.
